## Pseudo-Code

*(Provide detailed pseudo-code explaining the logic of your program. Outline your classes, their methods, and how they interact to produce the final model.)*

### Example Structure:

1. **Main Simulation Loop**

   - **Initialize Agents**:
     - Create instances of the Agent class with initial positions and velocities.
   - **Simulation Steps**:
     - For each time step:
       - **Agent Interactions**:
         - Agents interact with other agents and the environment.
       - **Agent Movement**:
         - Agents update their positions based on their velocities.
       - **Agent State Updates**:
         - Agents update any internal states or attributes.
       - **Data Collection**:
         - Record agent positions or other relevant data for visualization.

2. **Agent Class**

   - **Attributes**:
     - position: The agent's position in space.
     - velocity: The agent's velocity vector.
     - Other attributes as needed (e.g., state, neighbors).

   - **Methods**:
     - **move()**:
       - Updates the agent's position based on its velocity and other factors.
     - **interact(agents)**:
       - Defines how the agent interacts with other agents.
       - May include calculating forces, changing direction, or altering state.
     - **update()**:
       - Updates the agent's internal state after interactions and movement.

3. **Additional Classes** (if applicable)

   - **Environment**:
     - Represents the simulation environment.
     - May include methods for adding obstacles or boundaries.
   - **Obstacle**:
     - Represents obstacles in the environment that agents interact with.

## Technical Explanation

*(Provide a concise explanation of your code, focusing on how you implemented OOP principles and agent-based modeling. Discuss how your approach generates the final structural patterns and the mathematical or computational principles involved.)*

### Topics to Cover:

- **Object-Oriented Design**

  - Explain the classes you designed and why.
  - Discuss how you applied OOP principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
  - Describe how the classes interact within the simulation.

- **Agent Behaviors and Interactions**

  - Describe the rules governing agent behaviors.
  - Explain how agents interact with each other and the environment.
  - Discuss any algorithms or decision-making processes implemented.

- **Simulation Loop**

  - Explain how the simulation evolves over time.
  - Describe how time-stepping or iteration is handled.
  - Discuss any performance considerations.

- **Visualization**

  - Explain how the agent data is used to generate the final models.
  - Discuss any visualization techniques or tools used.

   - **Parameters Changed**:
     - cohesion_factor: [Value]
     - separation_distance: [Value]
   - **Description**:
     - Discuss the observed changes in the model.

3. **Variation 3: [Name/Description]**

   ![Variation 3](images/variation3.jpg)

   - **Parameters Changed**:
     - randomness: [Value]
     - environmental_influence: [Value]
   - **Description**:
     - Explain how the introduction of randomness or environmental factors impacted the results.

*(Add more variations as needed.)*

## Challenges and Solutions

*(Discuss any challenges you faced during the assignment and how you overcame them.)*

### Examples:

- **Challenge 1**: Managing large numbers of agents efficiently.
  - **Solution**: Implemented spatial partitioning to reduce computation time.
