Assignment 4: Agent-Based Model for Structural Tessellation Generation

Author: Your Name

Description:
This script implements an agent-based model using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
It simulates the behavior of agents to generate structural patterns, exploring how changes in
rules and parameters affect the resulting form.

Note: This script is intended to be used within Grasshopper's Python scripting component or as a standalone Python script.

    A class to represent an agent in the simulation.

    Attributes:
    - position: The current position of the agent (e.g., as a tuple or vector).

    Methods:
    - move(): Updates the agent's position based on its velocity and other factors.
    - interact(agents): Defines how the agent interacts with other agents.
    - update(): Updates the agent's state.
